🏠 House Price Prediction – AI/ML Web Application
The House Price Prediction System is a web-based machine learning project that predicts the selling price of a house based on multiple real-time input parameters. Designed with an intuitive and modern interface, this application leverages AI to provide accurate price estimations, helping users make informed decisions in the real estate market.

🚀 Features:
Landing Page: Welcomes users with a sleek UI and a “Start” button to begin the prediction process.

Prediction Form: Users can enter values such as:

Average Area Income

Average House Age

Average Number of Rooms

Average Number of Bedrooms

Area Population

Machine Learning Model: A trained regression model processes the input and instantly displays the predicted house price.

Clean Output Section: Displays the predicted price in an easy-to-read format.

🧠 Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS (modern UI styling), JavaScript (for dynamic input/output)

Backend: Python with Django

ML Model: Linear Regression trained on housing dataset

💡 Purpose:
To showcase the power of integrating machine learning with web technologies in real-world applications like real estate pricing, this project serves as a practical demonstration of AI-driven predictions in a user-friendly manner.
